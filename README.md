# SdetCodeChallenge2
Solution for the FetchCodingExercise-SDET by Venkata Nutalapati, vnuta9@gmail.com on Oct 13th 2023. It was a late submission. Among few assessments from Employers, I could only find this much time to get this implemented.
Notable Points for this solution:--
@1. The latesst Selenium version 4.14.0 has been used.
@2. No WebDriverManager(even though the dependency has been included in pom.xml file, it has NOT been used at all) or chromeBrowser executable is being downloaded or used.
@3. TestNG in it's latest edition has been used.
